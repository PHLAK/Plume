squareSome configuration values do not have corresponding environment variable. These values can only be controlled through their entries in the `app/config` files.

<Danger>
  When upgrading your application the files in `app/config` will be overwritten. If you make manual changes to these files be sure to back up any modifications before upgrading.
</Danger>

The application configs are broken up into separate files based on their use and give you full control over every application option and even allows full PHP code if desired.

<Tip>
  Plume utilizes PHP-DI for it's configuration. See the [PHP Definitions documentation](https://php-di.org/doc/php-definitions.html) documentation for more info on writing manual configuration definitions.
</Tip>

For additional information about individual configuration options reference the individual config documentation.

  More coming soon...
