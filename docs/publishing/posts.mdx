title: "Posts"
---

As a blog, the main purpose of Plume is facilitate authoring and publishing posts. This is made possible through Markdown files with a bit of YAML sprinkled in. To get started you may add your file with an extension of `.md` in the `data/posts` directory.

```
/path/to/plume
├── data
│   ├── posts # Put your posts in this folder
│   │   ├── some-amazing-post.md
│   │   └── yet-another-post.md
│   └── [other data]
└── docker-compose.yaml
```

<Note>
  The name of the file (not including the `.md` extension) will be used as the post "slug", the part that shows up in the URL. For example, for the file `data/posts/vogon-poetry.md` the URL would be something like `example.com/posts/vogon-poetry`.
</Note>

## Front Matter

In order for a post to be recognized by Plume it _must_ contain some metadata like a title and published date. This metadata is defined as "front matter", that is, some YAML set between tripple-dashes (i.e. `---`) and must be the first thing in the file.

``` vogon-poetry.md

## Post Images

To add images to your posts you may upload your images to the `data/files` folder and reference them in your posts in markdown or raw HTML.

```
![Image Alt Text](/files/some-image.png)
```

or

```
<img src="/files/some-image.png" alt="Image Alt Text"></img>
```

You may also organize your images in arbitrary sub-folders as well as long as your links follow suite. For example, an image at `data/images/some-post/example.png` can be added like so.

```
![Example Image](/files/images/some-post/example.png)
```
