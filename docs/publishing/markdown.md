# Markdown

Plume supports the extended set of Markdown known as
[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). For example, tables,
task lists, strikethrough text and bare URLs (auto-linked) are supported out of
the box.

```markdown
| Subject | Rating |
| ------- | ------ |
| Poetry  | 0/10   |
| Towels  | 5/5    |

- [x] Know where your towel is
- [ ] Enjoy Vogon poetry

~~So long, and thanks for all the fish.~~

For an overview of the Markdown syntax check out the
[Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and
[Markdown Extended Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)
guides.

In addition to the GitHub Flavored Markdown spec Plume supports some additional
features detailed below.

## Table of Contents

A table of contents can be rendered by adding the `[[TOC]]` placeholder to your
Markdown file where you would like it to be rendered. The placeholder will be
replaced with a list of links to the header tags (`h1` - `h6`) within the
document when published.

:::code-group
```markdown [dont-panic.md]{6}
---
title: Don't Panic
published: 1970-01-01 00:00:00
---

[[TOC]]

Your post contents goes here...
```
:::


## Heading Anchors

Every heading (i.e. `h1` - `h6`) is automatically assigned a permalink
anchor. Hovering over a heading reveals a `#` symbol which links directly to
that heading.

To link directly to a heading from elsewhere, append its anchor to the URL.

```text
example.com/post/my-post#content-my-heading
```

> [!NOTE]
> Heading anchors are prefixed with `content-`:

## Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are syntax highlighted with [Shiki](https://shiki.style). Tag a
fenced code block with a language to enable highlighting.

````markdown
```php
echo 'Hello, world!';
```
````

Shiki supports 100+ languages, see the
[Shiki Languages documentation](https://shiki.style/languages)
for the complete list.

> [!TIP]
> You may customize the theme used for highlighting via the
> [`SHIKI_THEME_ID`](../configuration/environment-variables.md#shiki-theme-id)
> environment variable.

## Alerts

"Alerts" (a.k.a. callouts or admonitions) are an extension of the blockquote
syntax useful for emphasizing important information. Alerts render as block
quotes with a distinctive color and icon to emphasize the content.

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
```

## Footnotes

Footnotes allow you to add annotations or references to your content. These
render as superscript markers linked to a list of notes at the bottom of the
document.

```markdown
The answer to life, the universe and everything is 42.[^1]

[^1]: See *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* for details.
```

## Description Lists

Description lists pair terms with their definitions.

```markdown
Vogon
: A bureaucratic alien race famous for their terrible poetry.
```

## HTML

Raw HTML may be used alongside Markdown in your content.

> [!WARNING]
> For security reasons `<script>` tags are not rendered. Script tags will be
> displayed as plain text in your content rather than executed.

See the [troubleshooting documentation](../help-and-support/troubleshooting.md)
for more information.

## Images

Images can be uploaded to the `data/files` folder and referenced in your post
markdown or raw HTML.

```markdown
![Image Alt Text](/files/some-image.png)
```

or

```html
<img src="/files/some-image.png" alt="Image Alt Text" />
```

Make sure you preface the file path with a forward slash (i.e. `/`).

You may also organize your images in arbitrary sub-folders as long as your links
follow suit. For example, an image at `data/images/some-post/example.png` can be
referenced like so.

```markdown
![Example Image](/files/images/some-post/example.png)
```

> [!TIP]
> You may use the [`BASE_URL`](../configuration/environment-variables.md#base-url)
> environment variable to rewrite relative image URLs in your rendered content,
> e.g. when serving your site from a different domain.
