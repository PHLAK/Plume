## Quick Start

<Note>
  Coming soon...
</Note>

## Docker Compose

For a long-term installation you can use Docker Compose to install Plume. To get started, create a directory for your Plume installation and, in that directory, add a `docker-compose.yaml` file and a folder for your data (e.g. `data`).

```
/path/to/plume
├── data
│   └── [your data will go here]
└── docker-compose.yaml
```

```yaml docker-compose.yaml
services:

  plume:
    image: phlak/plume:<version>
    environment:
      # ...
      # TIMEZONE: America/Phoenix
      # See configuration docs for additional variables
    ports:
      - <host_port>:80
	volumes:
	  <host_path>:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

<Info>
  Replace `<version>` with the version of Plume you'd like to run (e.g. `1.0.5`, `1.0` or `1`)

  Replace `<host_path>` with the path to a directory where your posts, pages and additional data will be stored.

  Replace `<host_port>` with the port on which you would like the application to be exposed.
</Info>

Once created, start the container by running `docker compose up -d` from the same directory as the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

<Tip>
  See the [Configuration Reference](https://docs.directorylister.com/configuration/configuration-reference) for a full list of the available environment variables.
</Tip>

## Docker Run

To get up and running quickly you can use `docker run` to launch a stand-alone Docker container from the official Docker image.

<Warning>
  This is a good way to test Plume for the first time but is _not recommended_ for long-term use. Instead we recommend using the Docker Compose installation method below.
</Warning>

```
docker run --detach [--env ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=value] \
    --volume <host_path>:/data --publish <host_port>:80 \
    phlak/plume:latest
```

<Info>
  Replace `<host_path>` with the path to a directory where your posts, pages and additional data will be stored.\
  \
  Replace `<host_port>` with the port on which you would like the application to be exposed.
</Info>

<Tip>
  You may pass multiple environment variables by repeating the `--env` flag.
</Tip>

## Manual Installation

<Warning>
  This is _not_ the recommended installation method and will require more work to update between versions. Instead we recommend using the Docker Compose installation method below for quick and easy updates.
</Warning>

<Note>
  More details coming soon including examples for

  - Nginx
  - Apache
  - Caddy
