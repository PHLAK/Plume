Plume allows customization through configuration. You can configure Plume in a few different ways. The simplest and \*recommended\* way to configure Plume is through environment variables.

## The `.env` File

Most configuration is possible via the `.env` file. You may define environment variables and their value in this file.

<Tip>
  This is the recommended method for configuring your app.
</Tip>

To get started:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Edit the configuration values in `.env`

```
/path/to/plume
├── data
│   └── [your data]
├── docker-compose.yaml
├── .env          # Edit this
└── .env.example  # Copy this
```

The default `.env` file should look something like this:

``` .env
APP_DEBUG=false
# SITE_TITLE="Yet another amazing blog"
# META_DESCRIPTION="Yet another amazing blog, published with Plume."
# PAGINATION=true
# POSTS_PER_PAGE=10
```

<Tip>
  You can find a list of environment variables and their function in the Environment Variables documentation.
</Tip>

## User Customization

<Warning>
  🚧 **Advanced user customization is currently in development.** 🚧\
  \
  If there's something you would like to be able to customize that isn't currently possible, open a feature request.
</Warning>

## Custom JavaScript and CSS

Arbitrary code like CSS & JavaScript may be included in the HTML output of your site through the `customizations` file injection. This is particularly useful for including analytics tracking code from [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com), [Matomo Analytics](https://matomo.org), [Umami Analytics](https://umami.is) or other similar analytics service.

To inject these  into your page, create a file named `customizations` in the data directory and place your code into this file.

```
/path/to/plume
├── data
│   ├── [other files and folders]
│   └── customizations  # Create this file
└── docker-compose.yaml
```

``` customizations
<!-- Put your custom code here -->
```
